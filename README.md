I am JB4443540, aka JB.
I'm pretty good at making music, I make art as well, but not the best kind of art.
He/him, straight, and support others part of the LGBT+ community as long as they aren't so, like, what you think they are.
Leather128 and Ronezkj15 are chads, you can not change my mind.
I have a Minecraft server going on right now, you can dm me on Discord if you would like to join the server. (JB#8697)
I play FNF (I can play up to 13k with all unique keys so far), Minecraft, multiple Nintendo Switch games, and more.
I love helping people out with stuff, but I literally can not code. I'm just an artist guy. (If you have problems in the real world, I help with that, too.)
